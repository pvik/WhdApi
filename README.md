# WhdApi

Note: I have no affiliation to SolarWinds and this is a third party API. This is _NOT_ supported by SolarWinds.

A java wrapper around the Web Help Desk REST API

The API is based on the [SolarWinds Web Help Desk REST API documentation for 12.2.0](http://www.solarwinds.com/documentation/webhelpdesk/docs/whd_api_12.2.0/web help desk api.html).

Please check out the [wiki](https://github.com/pvik/WhdApi/wiki) on how to use the API.
